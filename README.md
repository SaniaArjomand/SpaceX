SpaceX

SpaceX advertises Falcon 9 rocket launches on its website with a cost of 62 million dollars; while other providers cost upward of 165 million dollars each. Much of the savings is because SpaceX can reuse the first stage. Therefore, if we can determine whether the first stage will land successfully, we can specify the cost of a launch. This information can be used if an alternate company wants to bid against SpaceX for a rocket launch.

SpaceX Objective

We want to predict whether the rocket that launched before is able to land successfully? If it can land successfully, it would be able to be reused. We will use machine learning techniques to answer this question.

This project consists of following stages:

1.Importing all necessary packages

2.Gaining insight into the dataset

3.Preprocessing

4.Applying machine learning techniques

5.Exporting the top-performing model based on results for future deployment
